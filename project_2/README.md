# project overview
For project two, I chose to work with the poem "Meanwhile" by Richard Silken, one of my favorite poets. To me, this poem illustrates the feeling of starting over somewhere new. I’ve moved around to different places for most of my life, so I’ve never felt a secure sense of community. Now that I’ve been living here for some time, in the Bay, I feel like I am finally starting to find my community, although it takes some getting used to. The poem talks about life’s small, intimate moments that you may share with another person. Life is mundane, but the people you surround yourself with can help you find meaning in this mundaneness

# technical overview
The beginning of them poem starts out small, with lots of white space to evoke a sense of unfamiliary and emptiness. Throughout the poem, I tried to format it similar to how Silekn does in the original poetry book, it terms of the alignment and where lines start and end. I tried to use animations that fit with what the specific line of the poem is talking about, and I chose to end my pages, and link the next page, whereever I felt there was a transition in the mood of the poem. I used either black or white for the background color, depending on what I felt the mood was for that part. The background color shifts to black when the poem begins referecing nighttime, and then the last page shifts back to white to evoke a sense of a new beginning, as it talks about the fact that "it has only just begun." The poem also has numerous references of light or flickering, which I incorporated in to the animations.
